Bootcamp / Set Up Git 
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

First, you need to install Git on your machine https://git-scm.com
Install Git On Windows
Step 1: 
To download the latest version of Git,
Download Git for Windows  https://git-scm.com/download/win
 Select Launch Git Bash and click on Finish.
Step 2:
Let us proceed with configuring Git with your username and email. In order to do that, type the following commands in your Git Bash:
git config - - global user.name "<your name>"

git config - - global user.email "<your email>"

It is important to configure your Git because any commits that you make are associated with your configuration details.
If you want to view all your configuration details, use the command below:

git config --list
Now to check the version of Git installed  we will use the command:
git --version

Step 3:
git clone
Create a folder on your Desktop "repos"
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos>git clone https://github.com/larate/practical-sqa.git
Cloning into 'practical-sqa'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos>ls
practical-sqa

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos>cd practical-sqa

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>ls
README.md

Step 4: 
Add
This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree and then prepares the content in the staging area for the next commit.
Thus, after making changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index. For that, use the commands below:
git add <directory>
or
git add <file>
or 
git add .

Step 5:
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git commit -m "updated readme file for better description"
[master 26e459d] updated readme file for better description
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git log
 git --help
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git push -u origin master
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 330 bytes | 330.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/larate/practical-sqa.git

Step 6:
Do not push to the got without pull new changes from the origin 
git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 1), reused 6 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git log
see the branch with git branch -r.
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/first_branch
  origin/master

git fetch origin

This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:

git branch -v -a
With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:
git checkout -b test origin/test

git branch first_branch origin/first_branch

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -r
 git checkout -b remote_branch origin/remote_branch
$ git fetch origin

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/first_branch
  origin/master
git checkout remote_branch
Merging
Merging is the way to combine the work of different branches together. This will allow us to branch off, develop a new feature, and then combine it back in.
git merge <branch_name>
It is important to know that the branch name in the above command should be the branch you want to merge into the branch you are currently checking out. So, make sure that you are checked out in the destination branch.
