Bootcamp / Set Up Git 
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/

First, you need to install Git on your machine https://git-scm.com
Install Git On Windows
Step 1: 
To download the latest version of Git,
Download Git for Windows  https://git-scm.com/download/win
 Select Launch Git Bash and click on Finish.
Step 2:
Let us proceed with configuring Git with your username and email. In order to do that, type the following commands in your Git Bash:
git config - - global user.name "<your name>"

git config - - global user.email "<your email>"

It is important to configure your Git because any commits that you make are associated with your configuration details.
If you want to view all your configuration details, use the command below:

git config --list
Now to check the version of Git installed  we will use the command:
git --version

Step 3:
git clone
Create a folder on your Desktop "repos"
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos>git clone https://github.com/larate/practical-sqa.git
Cloning into 'practical-sqa'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos>ls
practical-sqa

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos>cd practical-sqa

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>ls
README.md

Step 4: 
Add
This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree and then prepares the content in the staging area for the next commit.
Thus, after making changes to the working tree, and before running the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or modified files to the index. For that, use the commands below:
git add <directory>
or
git add <file>
or 
git add .

Step 5:
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git commit -m "updated readme file for better description"
[master 26e459d] updated readme file for better description
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git log
 git --help
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git push -u origin master
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/larate/practical-sqa.git

Step 6:
Do not push to the git without pull new changes from the origin 
git pull origin master
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 6 (delta 1), reused 6 (delta 1), pack-reused 0

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git log
see the branch with많it branch -r.
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/first_branch
  origin/master

git fetch origin
This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git fetch origin

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -v -a

~/repos/practical-sqa --> git status

Step 7:
to create a new branch 
>git branch test_feature

git branch -v -a

git checkout: means to switch to that branch
 
git checkout test_feature
 
With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in, giving you a local working copy:
git branch first_branch origin/first_branch

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -r
 git checkout -b remote_branch origin/remote_branch
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -r
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/first_branch
  origin/master
git checkout remote_branch

Step 8:
after all changes has been made you are ready push you changes to the GitHub

git push origin first_branch

C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -a
* first_branch
  master

Step 9:

On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.	

In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
To the right of the Branch menu, clickNew pull request.

Use the막ase막ranch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into,
then use the맊ompare막ranch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
Type a title and description for your pull request. 
 Click Create pull request
After your pull request has been reviewed, it can be merged into the repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merging

Merging is the way to combine the work of different branches together. This will allow us to branch off, develop a new feature, and then combine it back in.
git merge <branch_name>
Merge all of the commits into the base branch막y clickingMerge pull request. If theMerge pull request맖ption is not shown, then click the merge drop down menu and selectCreate a merge commit.
It is important to know that the branch name in the above command should be the branch you want to merge into the branch you are currently checking out. So, make sure that you are checked out in the destination branch.
Common workflow 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Git branch my_feature
Git checkout my_feature
Git branch -a 
C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch -a
* first_branch
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/first_branch
  remotes/origin/master

Git add
Git commit -m ""
Git push -u origin my_feature
Git branch -a 

	1. First we are  switching to a master brunch  
Git checkout master
	2. We are pulling master from remote 

Deleting a branch 
// locally ((if you know what you are doing!) git branch -d localBranchName // and then if you need to... // on remote
 git pus origin :remoteBranchNameit pull origin master  
	3. We are merging our feature
	4. git branch --merged 
	C:\Users\Teacher\Desktop\repos\practical-sqa>git branch --merged
	* first_branch
	  master
	
	5. Git merge my_feature
	6. Git push origin master
	7. Git branch -d my_feature 
	8. Git branch -a 
	9. Git push origin --delete my_feature
	10. Git branch -a
